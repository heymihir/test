Subject: Confirmation on Data accuracy and Pivot Formats 

Steps to Generate Output Base File:

Place input files in the current data folder.
Run Clean_base_data.ipynb to clean the base data (one-time activity).
Update the customer master using Clean_base_data.ipynb whenever changes occur.
Execute Daily_Run.ipynb to generate the base file and output pivots (to be done daily).
Required Confirmations:

Pivot formats.
NTB customer validation: Need 9 March NTB tracker to match the NTB customer count.
Testing Results:
After reviewing the code output for March 5 and March 9, we observed an overall ~95% match, with an asset mismatch rate of ~10%, due to:

Missing asset data after MTD-06 in the manual file, causing discrepancies.
A difference in MTD average columns between the code output and the manual file. Manual verification aligns with the codeâ€™s calculations, indicating either a miscalculation in my averaging method or incorrect values in the manual file. Further validation is needed for a few sample users to confirm accuracy.
