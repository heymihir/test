Thanks for sending the files earlierâ€”they were very helpful.

We identified that the mismatch for non-funded data is due to the "Guarantees code" in our offline files.

Could you please re-run the query for non-funded data by including the product codes listed in the table below? Additionally, please add a new column named `prod_type` (currently, `prod_type` is an alias for the `type` column; we need it as an alias for the actual `prod_type`).
